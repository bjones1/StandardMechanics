# <p>Most buttons in the dialogue operate based on m_Xfer to determine how/when

# <p>The Line-scan/Area-scan buttons instead operate directly off of
#     m_Acquisition, and are only populated in the C++ version of the library.
# </p>
# <p>It would be possible to instantiate these buttons too, except that the
#     dialogues they would need to populate do not exist in the common C#
#     library of the demos.</p>
# <p>Creating the Linescan option seems to require writing a C# dialogue for
#     that</p>
